The dataset used for this project was obtained from TensorFlow.org datasets catalog https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar100

Description
This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a "fine" label (the class to which it belongs) and a "coarse" label (the superclass to which it belongs).
